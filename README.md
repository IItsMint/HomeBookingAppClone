# HomeBooking App - Airbnb Clone

## About Me
I am an aspiring software engineer with a background in electrical and electronics engineering. I am currently enhancing my skills by building a full-stack application, the HomeBooking app, which is a clone of Airbnb. This project utilizes my knowledge of Java, Spring Boot, and Angular to create a practical solution for learning web development.

## Project Description
